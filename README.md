# FlipperDumper

FlipperDumper extracts the resource files embedded in `LEGO Education SPIKE.dll`. The files are placed in the `FlipperDumper` folder on the desktop. There are over 10,000 files totaling nearly 1.2GB.

This software has only been tested with version 2.0.8 of the SPIKE software but it will probably work with other versions as well.

Flipper appears to be the internal code name for SPIKE, hence the name FlipperDumper.
